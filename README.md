# Shapes-hierarchy
The given header file implements a hierarchy of shapes in C++. It defines a base class called "Shape" with x and y coordinates representing the position of a shape. The "Shape" class provides default and parameterized constructors, accessor and mutator functions for the coordinates, and a virtual function to print information about the shape. It also includes a virtual copy() function to create a copy of a shape. The header file then defines three derived classes: "Circle," "Rectangle," and "RightTriangle." These classes inherit from the "Shape" class and add their specific attributes such as radius for circles, width and height for rectangles, and base and height for right triangles. Each derived class provides its own constructors, accessor and mutator functions, and an overridden printShape() function. The header file allows users to create instances of different shapes, manipulate their properties, and retrieve information about them. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for working with shapes in an object-oriented manner.
