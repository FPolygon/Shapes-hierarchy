# Shapes-hierarchy
The given shape header file implements a hierarchy of shapes in C++. It defines a base class called "Shape" with x and y coordinates representing the position of a shape. The "Shape" class provides default and parameterized constructors, accessor and mutator functions for the coordinates, and a virtual function to print information about the shape. It also includes a virtual copy() function to create a copy of a shape. The header file then defines three derived classes: "Circle," "Rectangle," and "RightTriangle." These classes inherit from the "Shape" class and add their specific attributes such as radius for circles, width and height for rectangles, and base and height for right triangles. Each derived class provides its own constructors, accessor and mutator functions, and an overridden printShape() function. The header file allows users to create instances of different shapes, manipulate their properties, and retrieve information about them. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for working with shapes in an object-oriented manner.

The provided canvas list header file, "CanvasList.h," contains the definition of two classes: "ShapeNode" and "CanvasList." The "ShapeNode" class represents a node in a linked list and contains a pointer to a "Shape" object and a pointer to the next node. The "CanvasList" class represents the linked list itself and provides a range of member functions to manipulate the list. These functions include inserting a shape at a specified index, adding shapes to the front or back of the list, removing shapes at a given index or from the front or back of the list, and accessing information about the list such as its size and the shape at a particular index. The "CanvasList" class also includes functions to draw the shapes on a canvas and print the memory addresses of the shapes and nodes in the list. Overall, this header file provides a flexible and efficient implementation of a linked list data structure specifically designed to store and manage shapes in a canvas-like environment.
